> **Note:** This project builds on the straightforward and flexible [Pokers](https://github.com/Reinforcement-Poker/pokers) environmentâ€”a minimalistic no-limit Texas Hold'em simulator designed for reinforcement learning. Pokers cuts out the fuss by using a simple `new_state = state + action` model, making it really easy to integrate with any framework. While its simplicity is a major plus, it's also a side project that might have some bugs in less-tested areas. If you need rock-solid reliability, you might consider alternatives like RLCard. Huge thanks to the creators of Pokers for their innovative and accessible work!

## Overview

This repository implements Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (Deep CFR), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm for solving imperfect information games. The implementation focuses on No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker, one of the most challenging games for AI due to:

- Hidden information (opponents' cards)
- Stochastic elements (card dealing)
- Sequential decision-making
- Large state and action spaces

The agent learns by playing against random opponents and self-play, using neural networks to approximate regret values and optimal strategies.

## Architecture

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **Model Architecture** (`model.py`)
   - Neural network definition
   - State encoding/representation
   - Forward pass implementation

2. **Deep CFR Agent** (`deep_cfr.py`) 
   - Advantage network for regret estimation
   - Strategy network for action selection
   - Memory buffers for experience storage
   - CFR traversal implementation
   - Training procedures

3. **Training Pipeline** (`train.py`)
   - Training loop implementation
   - Evaluation against random agents
   - Metrics tracking and logging
   - Model checkpointing and saving

## Technical Implementation

### Neural Networks

The project uses PyTorch to implement:

- **Advantage Network**: Predicts counterfactual regrets for each action
- **Strategy Network**: Outputs a probability distribution over actions

Both networks share a similar architecture:
- Fully connected layers with ReLU activations
- Input size determined by state encoding (cards, bets, game state)
- Output size matching the action space

### State Representation

Game states are encoded as fixed-length vectors that capture:
- Player hole cards (52 dimensions for card presence)
- Community cards (52 dimensions)
- Game stage (5 dimensions for preflop, flop, turn, river, showdown)
- Pot size (normalized)
- Player positions and button
- Current player
- Player states (active status, bets, chips)
- Legal actions
- Previous actions

### Action Space

The agent can select from four strategic actions:
- Fold
- Check/Call
- Raise 0.5x pot
- Raise 1x pot

### Counterfactual Regret Minimization

The implementation uses external sampling Monte Carlo CFR:
- Regret values are used to guide exploration
- Strategy improvement over iterations
- Regret matching for action selection
- Importance sampling for efficient learning

### Training Process

The training procedure includes:
- Data generation through game tree traversal
- Experience collection in memory buffers
- Regular network updates
- Periodic strategy network training
- Regular evaluation against random opponents
- Progress tracking via TensorBoard

## Performance Optimizations

The implementation includes various optimizations:
- Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
- Huber loss for robust learning with outliers
- Regret normalization and clipping
- Linear CFR weighting for faster convergence
- Efficient memory management

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NumPy

## Usage Guides

### DeepCFR Poker Training Guide

This guide provides a quick reference for training your Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (Deep CFR) poker agent using different methods.

#### Training Commands

##### Basic Training (vs Random Agents)

Train a new agent against random opponents:

```bash
python train.py --iterations 1000 --traversals 200
```

##### Continue Training from Checkpoint

Resume training from a saved checkpoint against random opponents:

```bash
python train.py --checkpoint models/checkpoint_iter_1000.pt --iterations 1000
```

##### Self-Play Training

Train against a fixed checkpoint opponent:

```bash
python train.py --checkpoint models/checkpoint_iter_1000.pt --self-play --iterations 1000
```

##### Mixed Checkpoint Training

Train against a rotating pool of checkpoint opponents:

```bash
python train.py --mixed --checkpoint-dir models --model-prefix t_ --refresh-interval 1000 --num-opponents 5 --iterations 1000
```

Continue an existing agent with mixed checkpoint training:

```bash
python train.py --mixed --checkpoint models/checkpoint_iter_1000.pt --checkpoint-dir models --model-prefix t_ --iterations 1000
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--iterations` | Number of training iterations | 1000 |
| `--traversals` | Number of game traversals per iteration | 200 |
| `--save-dir` | Directory to save model checkpoints | "models" |
| `--log-dir` | Directory for TensorBoard logs | "logs/deepcfr" |
| `--checkpoint` | Path to checkpoint file to continue training | None |
| `--verbose` | Enable detailed output | False |
| `--self-play` | Train against checkpoint instead of random agents | False |

| `--num-opponents` | Number of checkpoint opponents to use in mixed training | 5 |

#### Training Strategies

##### Random Opponent Training
- Fastest training method
- Good for initial learning
- Agent may overfit to exploit random play

##### Self-Play Training
- Trains against a fixed strong opponent
- Helps develop more balanced strategies
- May develop specific counter-strategies to the opponent

##### Mixed Checkpoint Training
- Most robust training method
- Prevents overfitting to specific opponent types
- Provides diverse learning experiences
- Closest approximation to Nash equilibrium training

#### Monitoring Training

Monitor training progress with TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs
```

Then open http://localhost:6006 in your browser.
